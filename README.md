Replication Code for (Bowman 2022)

This is NetLogo code to replicate the agent-based model which forms the center piece of my dissertation "Grassroots Networks: Interdisciplinary Modeling of Nomadic Social Organization in Premodern Central Eurasia" published in 2022. To open the model, just save the text document as something like model.nlogo and open it in NetLogo. I used NetLogo 6.2.2 to contruct the model.
